      <h2> For the Better Good </h2>
      <p> The purpose of this event is to provide information about the foster care system and
      how to become foster parents/adopt kids. While you may not be completely open to adopting/fostering
      a kid(s), coming to this event to speak with experts and those who are experienced in this field
      may help you recieve a better perspective of what foster care really is. I plan to hold this event
      at Brookwood Church sometime in July. After 11:00 sunday service, there will be information centers set up within the
      church where volunteers and foster care workers will be waiting and willing to speak to anyone.
      There will also be drop off baskets where the supplies listed below can be dropped off. These supplies
      will go to South Carolina Youth Advocate Program and Fostering Great ideas, two great companies that
      will give the supplies to foster kids in need of them. </p>

      <h2> About Fostering Great Ideas </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://fgionline.org/">Fostering Great Ideas</a> is a company located here in Greenville, SC that works with
        kids who struggle in the foster care system. Foster Care is a government run system
        where adults care for kids/teens under the age of 18 because they are not able to
        live with their biological parents. One of Fostering Great Ideas main goals is to
        stress that children in foster care are loved and do matter. Many kids go into the
        system because of unstable conditions. Being pulled out you're home no matter the
        circumstance is still a tough situation that can be hard to comprehend. So Fostering
        Great Ideas has many programs, such as “Operation Bear Hug” and “Making Memories”, to
        help support and provide for the children in the system. Not only does Fostering Great
        Ideas want to help mentally, but physically as well. With providing kids with necessary
        simple items they would need on a daily basis (i.e., clothes, jackets, shoes). In the
        system it has shown that nowadays more and more kids are getting permanent homes, but
        there are still several kids who age out. Last year an estimate of 20,000 kids aged out
        of the foster care system. 25% of kids who age out of the system become homeless for at
        least 4 years. They are also 2 times as likely to become an alcoholic and 7 times as likely
        to become a drug addict. Foster care is intended to be a temporary living situation until
        the child can either go back to their home or until they can find a permanent home. Foster
        Great Ideas wants to make sure that foster care is not a burden to this kids who are in it.

      <h3> What it's all about </h3>
      <p> The purpose of this event is to make those around us aware of what
        the foster care system is truly like. Hopefully, by learning about foster
        care, we can come together to help and provide homes, supplies, and love
        for the kids in the system. This webpage is not an offical web page. It
        is a project for my web page and design class. Thanks. </p>
